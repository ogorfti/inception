<--- Notes --->
- Docker is an engine that runs containers


<--- Docker Volumes --->

- Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers like databases, logs, etc.

types of volumes:
1. Named volumes (recommended) - `mydata:/var/lib/mysql`
2. Anonymous volumes - `/var/lib/mysql`
3. Host volumes - `/opt/data:/var/lib/mysql`

`Namespace:` define what resources can container access on the host machine.

`cgroup:` define how much of those resourses can container consume.

*Container from scratch:*
<br>

1. mount a directory: create a new root filesystem

2. unshare a namespace: Unsharing a namespace isolates the container's process space, providing it with a unique view of the system distinct from the host machine (unshare) is a sys 

3. chroot to a directory: Change the root directory of the process to the new root filesystem.

4. create a cgroup: Make a new cgroup to limit what the container can use.

5. set limits in the cgroup: Decide how much the container can use.

6. start application in the cgroup: Start the application in the cgroup.

*OCI (Open Container Initiative):*

- The OCI wants to make the container technology the same everywhere, like container pictures and runtimes and what is and how it should be done.

*CRI (Container Runtime Interface):*

- The CRI runtime is a plugin that allows Kubernetes to use different container runtimes like containerd, and CRI-O.

*Docker engine:*

- The Docker engine is a client-server application with these major components:
    - A server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process (the dockerd command).
    - A REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.
    - A command line interface (CLI) client (the docker command).

*Where is everything stored?*

- Images: /var/lib/docker
- Containers: /var/lib/docker
- Volumes: /var/lib/docker/volumes
- Networks: /var/lib/docker/network
- Docker socket: /var/run/docker.sock
- Docker configuration: /etc/docker/daemon.json
